# Description

Welcome to CocktaiList. This single-page web application is useful for any bartender looking for an easy place to house and maintain their drink reportoire. To use this website, a user can:
1. Navigate to Cocktail Résumé to see the list of cocktails in their reportoire and show this to others.
2. Navigate to Add to Résumé to add a new cocktail to their reportoire.

To add a new cocktail to their reportoire, the user will need to enter the cocktail name, liquor type, and a complete image link of the drink (for example, https://www.thecocktaildb.com/images/media/drink/54z5h71487603583.jpg).

# Setup
